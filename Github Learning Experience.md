**Github Learning Experience**
==============================

Before the start of this project, I rarely used Github to share code files with other classmates. After I created a new repository to store the new project materials, it took me awhile to figure out how to upload the files on to Github. Then, I realized that it was so convenient to share codes with my another teammate using "fork" function. I just needed to fork his Github repository; then we could co-edit on the same code files. A friend of mine, who studied CS in college, told me this amazing function of Github. Too shame, we realized the existence of such function so late. Most of our coding work went on during meetings and thankfully most of our meetings were pretty productive and we were able to crack the codes during the meetings and debug the codes afterwards. But still, Github helped us a lot when we tried to synthesized all our conetents, including the codes and qualitative analysis, altogether. 

Meanwhile, I found lots of helpful suggestions and answers posted on Github community by many experienced programmers. By somehow mimicking others' coding method, I was able to incoprate it into my own project and significantly boosted my working efficiency, for example, how to create graph for dictionary values, how to rank dictionary values in descending order, how to count empty space in a list, so on and so forth. To be honest, many answers were so creative and helped me to realize how versatile that Python was. There are lots of treasures in Github and I can't wait to explore.
